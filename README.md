# Joydrone
I want to control a drone with flightsim joysticks. The point of this project is to do that.

Currently, joydrone converts input from dual VBK Gladiator NXT EVO joysticks into CRSF frames, to be sent over an ELRS transmitter.

This will probably run on a Raspberry Pi, unless I decide that's too slow for real-world RC and switch to reading USB HID joysticks from a microcontroller.

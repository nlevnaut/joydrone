# Joydrone
I want to control a drone with flightsim joysticks. The point of this project is to do that.

Currently, joydrone converts input from dual VBK Gladiator NXT EVO joysticks into CRSF frames, to be sent over an ELRS transmitter via serial.

This will probably run on a Raspberry Pi, unless I decide that's too slow for real-world RC and switch to reading USB HID joysticks from a microcontroller.

DISCLAIMER: This is WIP, and if you use it I take zero responsibility for anything it is used for.
